For this project, I draw on three datasets:

1. Historical stock fundamentals
2. Historical stock prices
3. Historical S&P500 prices

I use the S&P500 index prices as a benchmark. 5% stock growth is insignificant if the S&P500 grew 10% in that time period, so it is important to think of stock returns relative to those of the index.
